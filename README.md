# Django Project - Shopping Cart
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/I_03kLfnnZY>
#### Description:
  To create a website for e-shopping, such as Amazon or eBay. I used Django, JavaScript, and Python to build this website.
Under "store" app, I created 4 html pages - Main.html, store.html, cart.html and checkout.html. I used sqlite to create
an administration account, to monitor what products, customers(authentication), and orders need to be added to the database.

  There are several features I have not managed to build or not successful. One is the number on the "cart" icon should have
been altered according to the number of items in the shopping cart. The other is for unauthorized users, the shopping cart
is failed to present the items of the products, which might be due to the settings of forms. Lastly, the "payment" button
has not been ready yet.

To sum up, it is my first time working with Django, and it has been a very inspiring and exciting experience. I would continue
exporing its power, adding Rest API and JavaScript, as well as advanced Python. Thanks to cs50 preparing me for all the foundations.
Hope one day I could be a front-end developer!
